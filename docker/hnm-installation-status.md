# Huddle Node Manager Installation Status

## Overview
This document summarizes the current state of the Huddle Node Manager (HNM) installation and the fixes that have been applied to resolve various issues.

## Installation Status

### HNM Core
- ✅ HNM is installed successfully on macOS (arm64)
- ✅ The `hnm` command is available and functional
- ✅ Basic HNM commands like `help` work correctly

### API Components
- ✅ API directory structure is correct
- ✅ PyTorch is installed with the correct architecture-specific version
- ✅ API key is configured and active
- ✅ API configuration file exists at `~/.ipfs/apim_config.json`
- ✅ API key directory exists at `~/.ipfs/api_keys`
- ✅ API client module works correctly
- ✅ Three of four services are available:
  - ✅ Embeddings service
  - ✅ OCR service
  - ✅ NLP service
  - ❌ Transcriber service (unavailable, likely a server-side issue)

### Docker Environments
- ✅ Docker images built for:
  - ✅ Linux (amd64)
  - ✅ WSL (amd64)
  - ✅ MinGW (amd64)
- ❌ macOS Docker image removed (not needed since we can test locally)

## Issues Fixed

1. **PyTorch Installation**: Fixed the PyTorch installation by installing the architecture-specific version for arm64.
2. **API Key Directory**: Created the missing API key directory at `~/.ipfs/api_keys` and copied the existing API key.
3. **Docker Space Issues**: Removed the macOS Docker image to free up space, keeping only the necessary environments.
4. **API Client Testing**: Created a comprehensive test script to verify the API client functionality.

## Test Scripts Created

1. **`test-local-installation.sh`**: Tests the HNM installation locally on macOS.
2. **`test-api-components.sh`**: Tests the API components of HNM.
3. **`fix-api-environment.sh`**: Fixes issues with the API environment, particularly the PyTorch installation and API key directory.
4. **`test-api-client.py`**: Tests the API client specifically, verifying that it can connect to the various services.
5. **`cleanup-docker-images.sh`**: Cleans up Docker images to free up space.

## Next Steps

1. **Transcriber Service**: Investigate why the Transcriber service is unavailable.
2. **Docker Testing**: When Docker is working properly, test the HNM installation in the Linux, WSL, and MinGW environments.
3. **Documentation**: Update the HNM documentation to include the fixes and test scripts created.
4. **Automated Testing**: Consider implementing automated testing for the HNM installation and API components.
